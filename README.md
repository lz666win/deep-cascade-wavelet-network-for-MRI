The data is collected on https://sites.google.com/view/calgary-campinas-dataset

you should download the data, then located them to the corresponding folder.

How to use:

make a folder: Test, then put e14498s5_P60928.7.npy into this folder.

make a folder: Models, then put 3 .hdf5 files into this folder.

make a folder: Data, Then you can run test_calgary_campinas_cart_5.ipynb to test it.
